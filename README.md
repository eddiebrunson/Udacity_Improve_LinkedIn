**How to Stand Out**

Imagine: You're a hiring manager and need to pick 5 people to interview for a role. You get 50 applications, and everyone seems pretty qualified. How do you compare job candidates? You'll probably pick the candidates that stand out the most to you - likely the people who communicate their motivation and dedication for the job.

**Personal Stories**

A job candidate's personal story is always unique to them. Employers aren't just looking for someone with the skills, but for someone who can help drive the company's mission forward. That's why they need to know your work ethic and what drives you.

Personal stories are memorable. Connect with your potential boss or colleague by telling your personal story. You want employers to know how you solve problems, overcome challenges, and achieve results. You want employers to know what excites you, what motivates you, what drives you forward.

All of this can be achieved through effective storytelling and building a personal brand.

**How to create your Elevator Pitch**

* What do you want employers to know about you? 
* What you are most proud of?

Explain what you are passionate about and what they know that you worked hard to get where you were. 


--> Example:

Hi, I'm Chris, a Full Stack Software Engineer who loves building education products. I recently developed a web app using AngularJS that lets teachers share student writing samples anonymously. I'd love to combine my passion for learning and teaching with my software development skills to continue building personalized learning products for people. 

**LinkedIn Summary Guidelines**

* Keep the summary to 3-5 points maximum.
* Use numbers where possible.
* Always use active instead of passive language.
* Include a call to action so that people are more likely to contact you for more information.

**Keywords and SEO**

As there are millions of LinkedIn users, you may be wondering how you stand out or are surfaced to recruiters. Below, we dive into the sections of your profile which are essential to SEO (search engine optimization - or optimizing your profile for searches on LinkedIn).

On your LinkedIn profile, more-so than on a resume or other application materials, it is helpful to use keywords specific to the job you are targeting. This is especially true of the words you include in your headline, summary, and current job title. Think of the words that a recruiter might type to search for candidates of your target job and check to ensure they're listed in your profile.

For example, if you were looking for a job developing mobile augmented reality apps, you might want to include words like engineer, iOS, Android, Unity, or 3D.

Pro Tip: To find keywords to add, read job descriptions of positions you are targeting.

For example, when you search "Udacity Software Engineer" on LinkedIn, you may find similar results to the image below. What do you notice about the search results?

___


**Headline**

Your headline should be one of the following options:

Your Current Job Title. This is the simplest but most effective way to optimize SEO; LinkedIn even defaults to suggesting you do this.
Your Education. If you do not yet have a job in your new industry, add your education such as "Data Analyst Nanodegree Graduate." You still include the key term "data analyst".
Your Target Job. Remember when Chris said his job search improved when he finally called himself a software engineer? If you're a Nanodegree graduate with a portfolio of real-world projects to share, feel confident and list your target job title.

**Summary**

You should already have your summary, crafted from your elevator pitch, from the exercise with Chris. If you need a refresher, just go back to "Use Your Elevator Pitch on LinkedIn." Your summary should:

Be written in first person, with a professional but conversational tone.
Include your key abilities and contributions.
Include 5 key skills (programming languages, software, etc.) for SEO purposes.

**Showcase Successful Work Experiences**

The Experience section of your LinkedIn profile should mirror your resume. Ensuring your resume and LinkedIn are consistent will help to build your personal brand.

In our free course on resume writing, we provide detailed guidance on how to describe your work experiences in a way that showcases success. Here are some guidelines to keep in mind for both resumes and LinkedIn profiles:

Be concise.

Include only relevant experience.

Keep each description to 3 bullet points or less.
At least 1 of these bullet points should demonstrate an individual contribution.

At least 1 of these bullet points should communicate a project result (success metrics, findings).

Always convey Action, Numbers, Success.

Action - Use active verbs to describe what you did.

Numbers - Quantify your accomplishments.

Success - Define each experience in terms of what you learned or achieved.

**Order matters.**

Make sure that your most relevant and most recent experience appears at the top of your profile.

**Accomplishments**

You can adapt the "Accomplishments" section of your LinkedIn profile to a wide variety of work experiences and achievements. For example, the "Accomplishments" section for "Projects" is an excellent place to showcase your Udacity projects! You can also list the Udacity courses you have taken in the "Accomplishments" section for "Courses."

When describing your projects be sure to include the specific technical skills you learned relevant to your target field. Think about the parts of your Udacity projects that you are most proud of and frame them as successes in your project description. Here are a couple good examples from Udacity alums:

Kristin, Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree Program Alum - Notice how Kristin uses the project section to showcase the technologies she has worked with (i.e. Unity, Oculus Rift). She also provides links to visuals for each project, so that it's easy for recruiters and connections to dive deeper into a project that piques their curiosity.

Michael, Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program Alum - Notice how Michael uses the "Projects" section to include more details about his experience with autonomous vehicles, and highlights his use of particular models like convolutional neural networks.
